#### Reduced Suport Vector Machine (RSVM)

♢ Formulated a simplified global nonlinear function for fitness landscape of
protein design.

− Developed a global nonlinear fitness landscape via a finite Newton method and
a rectangular kernel with a basis set of native proteins and decoys chosen a
priori,  
− Successfully predicted 95% native proteins from a large blind test set
including 428 native proteins and 11 million decoys.
